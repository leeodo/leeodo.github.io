            </h2>
            <p>Washington, DC has had higher violent crime rates, when compared to neighboring states, Maryland and
                Virginia.
                As of recently, 2021 wraps up as one of the DC region’s most violent years in ages. Crime rates in
                Washington,
                DC vary by ward, where particular wards are impacted at a higher rate than others. Increasing violent
                crime rates
                harm the overall wellness of individuals and communities. Understanding what factors lead to the
                increase in violent
                crime it may be possible to reduce their frequency. To address this challenge, we propose building a
                data visualization
                that allows city administrators to visually explore a dataset of violent crimes committed by types of
                neighborhoods and
                explore what demographical, economical, and sociological factors are commonly associated with wards with
                those who
                experience higher rates of violent crime. This app will show the distribution of factors contributing to
                crimes
                committed and allow users to explore different aspects of this data by filtering and re-ordering
                different variables
                to compare factors that contribute to neighborhoods/ areas with high crime rates. We will focus on the
                different wards
                of Washington DC and will use some cities and counties in Maryland and Virginia.</p>

            <h2>
                <center>Introduction</center>
            </h2>
            <p>Crime is a significant concern for all, including city officials, businesses, everyday citizens, and
                other stakeholders.
                The prevalence of crime in a city often results in negative economic, political, environmental, and
                societal consequences
                that have lasting effects. As students living in Washington, DC, we're curious about crime rates in the
                newest city we reside
                in, Washington, DC. Using data from various datasets provided by the Washington, DC Metropolitan Police
                Department and multiple
                datasets on the OpenData DC website to better understand crime rates in Washington, DC, and neighboring
                states. </p>
            <br>
            <p>In general, data visualizations of crime are helpful for all stakeholders to predict crime risk, improve
                community relations,
                form budgets, allocate resources, and more. We believe that different groups will benefit from our data
                visualization.
                For example, those new to Washington, DC, will be able to use our visualizations to make informed
                decisions on their housing
                and ensure their safety. Similarly, business owners may be able to use our data visualization to better
                equip their business
                with better protective measures, such as investing in better insurance for their business. Our data
                visualizations are also
                helpful for policymakers within the Washington, DC government, who aim to decrease crime for the health
                and safety of community
                members. By providing different economic, social, and demographic characteristics of neighborhoods with
                high and low crime rates,
                we hope to highlight variables that directly or indirectly influence crime rates. </p>
            <br>
            <p>The project's main objective is to answer the following questions 1) what do crime rates look like in
                Washington, DC when compared
                to neighboring states, Maryland and Virginia throughout time? 2) What are the crime rates in Washington,
                DC? How do crime rates
                vary across neighborhoods and different wards in the city? 3) What are the most common types of crimes
                in Washington, DC?
                4) What social, economic, and political characteristics correlate with the most common type of crime in
                Washington, DC? </p>
            <br>
            <p>To answer the questions listed above, our team used various interactive and non-interactive
                visualizations that city members,
                businesses, community members, and other stakeholders can utilize. We created visualizations assuming
                that our audience is groups
                who take a glance at data and do not have a technical background. </p>

                    the U.S. from 1960 to 2019. The crime reports are categorized into property (Burglary, Larceny,
                    Motor) and violent crime (Assault, Murder, Rape, Robbery). We will use the subset containing only
                    the information about the DMV area, partially as a reference for the other datasets.</li>
                <li>DC Crime dataset is an incident-based dataset. Every row is an incident that contains detailed time
                    elements, geographic elements, and crime category elements. This data is made public by the
                    Washington, DC Metropolitan police department. The whole dataset includes data as early as eight
                    years ago. So it’s a very comprehensive dataset.</li>

            <h3>Data Preprocessing</h3>
            <p>We preprocessed the data to make it easier to use. We used the following methods for each file:</p>

            <h4>DC Crime Dataset</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>After reading the data, the columns that are “datetime” type are converted to the corresponding
                    type. Then data is aggregated by different types of tables for later use. This includes the number
                    of crimes per day, the number of crimes per day by different types, the number of crimes per day per
                    ward, the number of violent crimes per ward in 2020, etc.</li>
                <br>
                <li>The latest data on social characteristics are in the year 2020, thus above tables were later
                    filtered for the year 2020 only.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>The four datasets are summarized in 8 wards and these data are later joined to existing datasets

                        <h8>Method: The time series plot above displays total crime rates from 1960 to 2019 in Washington, DC, Virginia, and Maryland, also known as the DMV. This plot was created in R using the plotly package. Readers can interact with the plot by clicking on the graph to focus on particular time periods or states.

                        <p>Washington, DC, significantly has the highest rate of crime when compared to neighboring
                            states, Maryland and Virginia.
                            Compared to Maryland and Virginia, the crime rates in Washington, DC have had much more
                            fluctuation throughout time.
                            As seen in Figure-1, while crime rates were fairly low in 1960 in Washington, DC, Maryland,
                            and Virginia, Washington,
                            DC’s crime rate spiked in the 1970s, while crime rates in Virginia and Maryland remained
                            relatively low. We see a similar
                            spike in the late 1970s, followed by a sharp decline in the early 1980s. We see the same
                            sharp rise and a sharp decline from
                            the mid - 1980s to the 1990s. Crime rates for Washington, DC, Maryland, and Virginia had a
                            sharp decline since the mid-1990,
                            most likely as a result of the <a href="https://www.ncjrs.gov/txtfiles/billfs.txt"> Violent
                                Crime Control Act and Law Enforcement Act of 1994</a>
                            passed by president Bill Clinton.
                            Despite the decrease in crime most likely triggered by the crime bill, Washington, DC
                            continues to have higher crime rates
                            than neighboring states Maryland and Virginia. </p>

                            Each line represents a ward and for visual clarity, a more colorful palette is used so the

                            more distinguishable for comparisons even when they overlap. It successfully shows the

                        <br>
                        <p>Since the crime rates in Washington, DC are way higher than in Virginia and Maryland
                            throughout the time,
                            we decided to take a closer look at only DC’s crime rates. From a holistic approach, we
                            plotted the time series
                            line plot of crime incidents in DC by ward from 2014 to 2021. As shown in Figure-2, Ward 2
                            has been on the top of
                            the ling graph throughout the years, which means Ward 2 has the highest crime incidents in
                            DC, whereas Ward 3 has
                            the lowest crime incidents in DC.
                            <br>
                            From Figure-2, it is worth mentioning the spike of crime incidents in June 2020, during the

                        <h8>Figure-3: Marker Cluster 2020</h8><br>
                        <h8>Method: This visualization is meant to show a more detailed distribution of crimes that happened
                            in DC.
                            This used the
                            same data as the overall crime choropleth since it contains longitude and latitude. The
                            markers are
                            added one by one and the leaflet package is smart enough to aggregate markers based on
                            location. The map has many circles zooming in and out. The number on the circle represents
                            the number of
                            crimes
                            happened in the area. When users hover their mouse on a circle, it will show a polygon
                            corresponding to
                            the area the specific circle represents. Furthermore, the color of the circle is a gradient
                            of numbers
                            as
                            green is low and orange is high.</h8><br>
                        <h8>Innovative: This marker cluster map replaces scatter plots on a map. A scatter plot would be
                            sufficient if there are fewer dots on a map because the audience can see the density and
                            geometry information wouldn’t be blocked. The marker cluster makes the map less “busy” so
                            that the audience can see the geometry information on a map. If an audience wants to see the
                            detailed location information of each incident, an audience just needs to scroll up and the
                            map would zoom in and show individual incidents.</h8>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>As shown in Figure-3, there were a total of 27,932 crimes in Washington, DC in 2020. When
                            zoomed in, the crime count
                            is divided to the east of the Anacostia River and west of the Anacostia River at 755 and
                            27,177 crime counts,
                            respectively. When we continue to zoom in we're able to see crime counts by neighborhood and
                            even down to crime
                            counts by streets. Using the information gained from Figure-2, individuals, businesses, and
                            city officials are able
                            to understand crime occurrences better.

                            <br>

                            For example, imagen a potential student deciding between attending American University,
                            Howard University,
                            Georgetown University, and George Washington University. This particular student factors in
                            crime occurrence as
                            an important deciding factor and therefore reviews Figure-3. This student can zoom into each
                            school's neighborhoods
                            to gain information on crime occurrences. We see that the Georgetown area has had 585 total
                            crimes and Foggy Bottom,
                            where George Washington is located, had 104 crimes in 2020. American University Park and
                            neighborhoods surrounding
                            Howard University each had 112 crimes in 2020. Based on information gained from Figure-3,
                            Georgetown Washington
                            University may be more attractive to the student due to the lower count of crime in the
                            foggy bottom neighborhood.

                            map is continuous in the area and the density is represented by light orange(low) and

                            During the initial view, where the map is zoomed out, we gain two significant pieces of
                            information.
                            1) DC has a high crime count 2) areas on the outskirts of DC that border Maryland and
                            Virginia have
                            lower crime counts. This information is represented by a lighter shade of red on the
                            outskirts and the
                            darker red in the skirt of the city. Once we continue to zoom in, Figure-4 further
                            visualizes streets and
                            areas with high crime rates. Areas with higher crime concentrations include Dupont Circle,

                            residents, each with its rich
                            history, vibrant neighborhoods, and a diverse population. As shown in Figure-5, these wards
                            have different
                            characteristics, including crime counts. Wards 2, Ward 5, and Ward 7 had the highest crime
                            counts at 4684, 4394,
                            and 4194, respectively. Ward 3 significantly has the lowest crime count of 1710. Figure-5 is
                            particularly useful
                            for Advisory Neighborhood Commissions.

                                in Washington DC</a>. ANCs are elected volunteers who serve two-year terms. The ANCs
                            were established to
                            bridge the gap between the government and the people. There are now 40 ANCs, with each ANC
                            area subdivided into
                            many smaller neighborhoods. Since only one Commissioner is elected per district, they are
                            called Single Member
                            Districts (SMDs). The ANCs may also initiate recommendations for improving city services,
                            conduct neighborhood
                            improvement programs, and monitor resident complaints. ANCs can view figures to
                            gain information on
                            crime counts in their respective wards.

                        <h8>Method: This is a horizontal violin plot showing the crime distributions in DC through the year of 2020. The distributions
                            of all the crimes are essential to answer our questions.
                            It uses the colorblind-friendly palette "OrRd" which will be used throughout the project. Wider violin 
                            represents a higher frequency of crimes, and it successfully visualized the crime distributions of different types 
                            of crimes. It did better than the original violin plot from the midterm release in terms of both information conveyed

                             consistently and frequently on daily basis. Another observation is that the spike in sexual abuse takes place in July,

                        <p>So far, we have investigated the crimes in DC in a general fashion through various aspects. 
                            We wanted to provide our audience a more direct and intuitive idea about the general crime 
                            conditions in DC, with the help of two wordclouds, featuring the crime types and wards respectively. <br>
                            Given the definition of violent crime by <a
                                href="https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/crimes/violent-crime"> the Natoinal Institute of
                                Justice</a>
                            that “a violent crime include rape, and sexual assault, robbery, assault, and murder”, we
                            found that lots of words in our wordcloud visualization
                            are under the category of <b>violent crimes</b>.

                            <br>

                            Violent crimes are harmful to the health and well-being of people. Survivors of violent
                            crime endure physical
                            pain and suffering and may also experience mental distress and reduced quality of life.
                            Research on post violence
                            consequences finds that exposure to violence can negatively affect the ability to sustain
                            employment. Women who are
                            physically assaulted are significantly more likely to have unstable employment than women
                            who do not experience
                            intimate partner violence (IPV; Crowne et al., 2011)
                            <br>
                            From Figure-2, it is worth mentioning the spike in crime incidents in June 2020, during the
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests_in_Washington,_D.C.">George
                                Floyd protests
                                in Washington DC</a>, when riots, protests, and acts of violence were happening for more
                            than a month.

                            <br>
                        <p>Figure-8 means the bigger the size of the word is, the more crimes that happended in that area.
                            Therefore, we know that
                            Ward 5 and Ward 7 have the most crime incidents in DC in 2020.

                                characteristic data and dc crime data in 2020.

                                The tooltip function allows the audience to have a clear idea of the education
                                status and violent crime rate
                                in each ward.

                                The calculation of ‘No High School Degree’ is using the total population of each ward to
                                subtract the
                                population with a high school degree and higher and times 100 to get the percentage rate of

                                high school diploma in each ward.

                            <p> From Figure-9 and Figure-10, we know that Ward 6 and Ward 3 are the top two areas that
                                have the largest population holding high school or above diploma, and Ward 3 has the most population with
                                a graduate degree
                                or higher education, which means Ward 3 has the most highly educated people in DC.

                                <br>

                                After getting ourselves familiar with the education status in DC in 2020, we compared
                                the low educated
                                population with violent crime rates in each ward. We found out Ward 7 and 8 have the most violent crime rates 
                                per 1,000 as well as the highest rates of low educated population. Ward 3 has the lowest
                                violent crime rate
                                and the second-lowest low educated population.

                            <h8>Method: The housing dataset contains three main features: number of bedrooms, monthly rent, and the percentage
                                of rent over the owner's income, and each of them has several categories. 
                                A stacked bar chart would be a perfect option to show both the total number of households in each ward and the 
                                specific structures of these households (represented by the colored stacks). 
                                The tooltips will show the name of that category (e.g. 1 bedroom, 35%-39.9%), the number of households in that category, and the ward number.
                                A dropdown menu with the function of selecting different variables (features) 
                                is incorporated, enabling the viewer to see structural differences between the features other than only making comparisons 
                                between wards. Another exciting feature of the plot is that viewers can select the categories in the legend and make further 
                                exploration of the housing condition without destroying the format of the bar chart. A new bar chart will form instead of losing

                                 has both the largest number and largest fraction of households having 0 or 1 bedroom. Ward 2 also has a high fraction of people
                                 paying rent over $2000. However, when it comes to the rent/income percentage, all the wards share a similar structure. Based on 
                                 the plot, we could find some traces of correlation between housing conditions and crime incidents but it's far from drawing some 
                                 valid conclusions.

                            <h8>Method: This linked interactive scatter plot is made by plotly in Rstudio. There are two scatter plots, one looking at the relationship between the share of the Black violent crime rate and another scatter plot looking at the relationship between the share of White and violent crime rates.

                            <p>Based on Figure-14 can see that racial demographic is an essential variable in predicting violent crime rates. The share of the Black population is positively correlated with violent crime rates, while the percentage of the white population is inversely correlated with violent crime rates. Based on Figure-14 and information gained from previous figures, this may mean that due to current and historical racism, Black people tend to live in areas that experience high poverty rates, high unemployment rates, and other factors that enhance violent crime rates.

                            <p>For this project, we initially imagined looking into Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia(DC) simultaneously. However, after sourcing and analyzing the data, we changed our focus primarily on DC, not only because the quality of data publicly available is much higher in DC but also because we can have a more focused perspective. Thus, we can dive deeper into the crime situation in DC by looking at multiple social characteristics other than crime solely. By focusing on DC, we had enough time to think about the stakeholders, the findings and thoughts put into can potentially be applied to other areas of the nation. We could dive even deeper into DC and the initial proposal for all three areas was unrealistic for the given amount of time in the semester.

The plot is represented as a screenshot instead. A rasterized version of this plot was considered as well, but it was still too big for GitHub to accept.</p>

                    <p>By utilizing data visualization tools, we can answer our initial research questions. Our visualizations indicate that Washington, DC, has a higher crime rate than neighboring states. Crime in Washington, DC varies by neighborhood and ward, and violent crimes, including rape, sexual assault, robbery, assault, and murder, are the most common crimes. We also find social and economic factors impact the occurrence of violent crime. Our key takeaways are as follows.

                    <p>These key takeaways are helpful for our different stakeholders, including policymakers, businesses, and community members. For example, policymakers interested in decreasing the crime rate can use the key finding from the social and economic to prevent crime in the long run. Since communities with a high share of people with a high school diploma and an increased percentage of employment have lower crime rates, policymakers can propose efforts to increase jobs and high school graduation to decrease crime rates. </p>

            </center>

            <p>Crime is a significant concern for all, including city officials, businesses, everyday citizens, and other stakeholders. The prevalence of crime in a city often results in negative economic, political, environmental, and societal consequences that have lasting effects. As students living in Washington, DC, we're curious about crime rates in the newest city we reside in, Washington, DC. Using data from various datasets provided by the Washington, DC Metropolitan Police Department and multiple datasets on the OpenData DC website to better understand crime rates in Washington, DC, and neighboring states.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>We asked four questions to investigate crime rates in Washington, DC. 1) What do crime rates look like in Washington, DC when compared to neighboring states Maryland and Virginia throughout time? 2) What are the crime rates in Washington, DC? How do crime rates vary across neighborhoods and different wards in the city? 3) What are the most common types of crimes in Washington, DC? 4) What social, economic, and political characteristics correlate with the most common type of crime in Washington, DC?</p>
            <br>
            <p>We created a series of visualizations to answer these questions. We find that 1) crime rates in DC vary by ward, neighborhood, and street of DC. 2) the highest unemployment and violent crime rate. 3) Wards with the highest share of the Black population, also have a higher share of violent crime rates. 4) Wards with a lower share of people without a high school diploma have a lower share of crime rates.</p>
            <br>
            <p>These results are insightful for businesses, policymakers, and community members.  With more time, data, and resources, we believe we can expand our analysis to draw meaningful results. In the future, we hope to also analyze data on police funding, homeless population, and other variables to better provide predictive measures that our stakeholders can use.</p>
